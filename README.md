A complete implementation of secure Ethereum smart contracts with comprehensive testing and auditing procedures.

## Features

- ERC20 Token implementation with mint/burn functionality
- Advanced contract with security features:
  - Reentrancy protection
  - SafeMath operations
  - Circuit breaker pattern
  - Proper access controls
- Complete test suite including:
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - Penetration tests
- Security audit tools integration
- Deployment scripts for multiple networks

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm or yarn
- Truffle Suite (`npm install -g truffle`)
- Ganache CLI (`npm install -g ganache-cli`)
- Python 3 (for Slither)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com//ethereum-smart-contract.git
cd ethereum-smart-contract
npm install
```

Usage
Compile Contracts

```bash
truffle compile
```
Run Tests
Start local blockchain:

```bash
ganache-cli -d
```
Run tests:

```bash
truffle test
```
Security Analysis
Run Slither (static analysis):

```bash
slither . --exclude-dependencies
```
Run Mythril (security analysis):

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/contract mythril/myth analyze /contract/contracts/AdvancedContract.sol
```
Deployment
Create a .env file with your secrets:
```
MNEMONIC="your wallet mnemonic"
INFURA_API_KEY="your infura key"
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="your etherscan key"
Deploy to Ropsten testnet:
```

```bash
truffle migrate --network ropsten
```
Verify on Etherscan:

```bash
truffle run verify MyToken AdvancedContract --network ropsten
```
